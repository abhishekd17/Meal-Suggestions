## 🌟 **Project Features**

- 🔢 **Personalized Caloric Recommendations**: Calculates daily caloric needs based on age, gender, weight, height, and activity level.
- 🍽️ **Custom Meal Plans**: Suggests meals to help users gain, lose, or maintain weight.
- 🥦 **Nutrient Tracking**: Identifies vitamin deficiencies and recommends foods to address them.
- 🛒 **Shopping List Generator**: Creates a grocery list based on meal plans.
- 🔄 **Adaptive Suggestions**: Learns user preferences over time to improve recommendations.

## 🚀 **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (for frontend and backend with TypeScript support)
- TypeScript
- Python (for data preparation and model training)
- Git

### **Setup Instructions**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-meal-suggestion.git
   cd ai-meal-suggestion
   ```

2. **Install Backend Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install Frontend Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set Up the Database**:
   - Create a database named `meal_suggestions`.
   - Update the database configuration in `backend/src/config.ts`.

5. **Train the Machine Learning Model**:
   - Ensure you have a labeled meal dataset (nutritional data, dietary restrictions, etc.).
   - Use Python and libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Scikit-learn to train the model.
   - Save the trained model and expose it through an API endpoint in the backend.

6. **Run Migrations**:
   ```bash
   cd ../backend
   npm run migrate
   ```

7. **Start the Application**:
   - Backend:
     ```bash
     npm run start
     ```
   - Frontend:
     ```bash
     cd ../frontend
     npm start
     ```

## ⚙️ **How It Works**

1. **Input Data**:
   - Users provide details such as age, height, weight, gender, dietary goal, and restrictions.
   - Input recent meals to help the system analyze vitamin deficiencies.

2. **Caloric Needs Calculation**:
   - Uses the Mifflin-St Jeor equation to calculate Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR).
   - Adjusts for activity level to determine Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE).

3. **Meal Recommendations**:
   - Suggests meals based on:
     - Caloric requirements.
     - Vitamin deficiencies.
     - Dietary restrictions.
   - Recommendations improve over time based on feedback.

4. **Machine Learning Integration**:
   - A trained model recommends meals tailored to the user's nutritional needs.
   - Model uses a dataset of meals with nutritional values and user preferences.

5. **Output**:
   - Users receive a personalized meal plan.
   - Includes a nutrient breakdown and grocery list.
